# dashboard

A browser project to mock up a dashboard of a website to present projects.

This project utilizes grid displays for the layout of the website. Most, if not
all aspects of the website are grids or nested grids to showcase usage of grid and
it's usefulness in structuring a website's layout. This webpage is a mock up of a 
dashboard for a website that would be used to present projects to others. My own
projects are linked in the "Your Projects" section to present my own projects in
this webpage project.
